    ">* Headers must appear in heirachical order (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) and there can only be one title (`#`).\n",
    "> * Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "> * File naming convention is as follows: XX_ENGN3903_practicalName. Where 'XX' represents the practical number (1-12), 'ENGN3903' is the course code and does not change, and 'practicalName' should be changed according to the practical aims and main topics.\n"

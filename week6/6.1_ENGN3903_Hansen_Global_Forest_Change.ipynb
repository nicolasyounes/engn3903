The image is rendered with transparency set by the mask, with zero being completely transparent and one being completely opaque.  i.e., You can mask an image with itself.

Use the `and()` method to create the lossAndGain image and display pixels where both loss and gain occur and then discuss the changes you see, with reference to the locations and patterns of forest change, and briefly hypothesize why these changes might be occurring (using referencing if you consult literature).

The discrimination of information refers not only to the spatial detail (spatial resolution) but also to the number of spectral wavebands, their bandwidths, and spectral cover (spectral resolution), the temporal frequency of observations (temporal resolution) and the signal to noise ration or its ability to distinguish vitiations in the energy detected (radiomatric resolution). One may also have to consider the sensor's potential to acquire information at different viewing angles (angular resolution) or polarization channels (polimetric resolution).\n"

We then _reduce_ that time-series (collapse the time-dimension) with the function `.median()`, which will create what Earth Observation scientists call a 'composite image', that is, an image that is representative of all images over a given time. Individual remote sensing images can be affected by noisy data, including clouds, cloud shadows, and haze. To produce cleaner images that can be compared more easily across time, we can create 'summary' images or 'composites' that combine multiple images into one. Median summaries are an extremely useful and very commonly used approach to summarising time-series of satellite images."

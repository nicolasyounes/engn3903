    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative remote sensing is the process of developing models that relate measured biophysical variables to the pixel values in an image. For example, after going to the field and working in the lab you now have a range of measured variables of individual trees that tell you a lot about the potential of the trees to catch fire. We call this 'Flammability', and flammability is driven by the water content in the leaves, and the leaf mass. The normalized difference water index (`NDWI`) is used to monitor changes in water content of vegetation (Gao, 1996), therefore it might be useful to monitor the flammability of eucalyptus trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few days you measured the water content and the mass of many leaves, and you used these biophysical variables to quantify the Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) of eucalyptus trees in two plots in the National Arboretum Canberra. However we are interested in estimating the FMC of eucalyptus trees in the Canberra region not just in the Arboretum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the FMC of eucalyptus trees in the Canberra region, we need to create a model that relates the measured FMC, and a larger dataset like a Sentinel 2 image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims of the practical session\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this session is to: \n",
    "- determine how different biophysical variables change the reflectance of the leaves (using simulated spectra),"

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the aims above, \n",
    "\n",
    "First we will:\n",
    "- Use the simulated leaf spectra to describe how each biochemical component changes the leaf spectra,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, we will use spectra simulated using PROSPECT-D which is a software program that simulates directional–hemispherical reflectance and transmittance from live and senesced leaves over the 400 nm to 2500 nm range of the electromagnetic spectrum (Jacquemoud & Baret, 1990, Fourty et al., 1996, Jacquemoud et al., 1996 and Jacquemoud et al., 2000). ). \n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption of light by photosynthetic pigments which predominates in the visible (VIS) spectrum was long assumed to be entirely caused by chlorophylls, although carotenoids and anthocyanins may also be significant. The absorption of light by water and the leaf structural components (e.g. cellulose and lignin) affects the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions of the spectrum. \n",

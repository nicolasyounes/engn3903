    "**Microwave remote sensing** provides a unique capability for direct observation of soil moisture. The microwave portion of the spectrum covers the range from approximately 1cm to 1m in wavelength. The longer wavelength microwave radiation can penetrate through cloud cover, haze and dust and allows detection of microwave energy under almost all weather and environmental conditions. \n",

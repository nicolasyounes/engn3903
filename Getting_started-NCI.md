# Getting started using the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)

## What is the NCI?

The [NCI](https://nci.org.au/) is Australia's pre-eminent, publicly-owned supercomputing facility located at Australia's National University.  In this course, we will use the NCI to conduct all our analysis. 

## Why use the NCI?

* Access very large compute resources anywhere with only a web browser.
* On-demand Jupyterlab resources make using a supercomputer really easy. 
* Python, R, and Julia environments pre-built and actively maintained by the NCI staff.
* Utilise data storage that’s vast and backed up – far more robust than local hard drives.
* Make your work more reproducible, virtual environments lock in an environment space that can be replicated by others – this makes reproducing your code/science much easier.
